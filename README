=====================================

A simple system that corrects the spawn of players without knowing anything
about the mapgen that is used.


Usage
=====

To activate the system, add it to your `depends.txt` and call this in your
`init.lua.`:

    spawnusher.activate()

Optionally, you can set parameters when activating it, it accepts three
parameters:

 1. `random_placement_radius`, the player will be randomly placed around
    the spawn point inside the given radius.
    Defaults to 40.
 2. `required_bubble_size`, the size of the air bubble that is required for
    the player to be placed there. Note this is only the vertical size.
    Defaults to 2.
 3. `retry_time`, if the player can't be placed because a block is not loaded
    yet, this is the amount of time that is elapsed until a retry.
    Defaults to 0.5 seconds.


Caveats
=======

There is a good chance that the player is placed inside a cave if
the `required_bubble_size` is small, like 2. If you want to prevent that, just
pick a `required_bubble_size` that is large enough to avoid caves, 10 should
work for the most part, for example.
